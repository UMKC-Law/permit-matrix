# General

This application uses Java (Spring boot) on the server and Angular/Bootstrap on the client. The initial project was generated using JHipster. Full background on  JHipster, including the installation requirements, can be found in the next section of this document.

No particular integrated development environment ("IDE" - such as Eclipse or IntelliJ Idea) is required or assumed. Local project files for a particular IDE should not be checked into the repository. Here's some guidance on configuring some popular IDEs to import the code (note - this project uses Gradle, rather than Maven): http://jhipster.github.io/configuring-ide/. And this is a nice discussion on your options for running the code: http://jhipster.github.io/development/.

In addition to the installation requirements listed in the JHipster section, you will need a Java 8 JDK. 

# Technology Stack Background - JHipster 

This application was generated using JHipster, you can find documentation and help at [https://jhipster.github.io](https://jhipster.github.io).

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools (like
[Bower][] and [BrowserSync][]). You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in package.json.

    npm install

We use [Gulp][] as our build system. Install the Gulp command-line tool globally with:

    npm install -g gulp

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./gradlew
    gulp

Bower is used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in `bower.json`. You can also run `bower update` and `bower install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `-h` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `bower update -h`.


## Building for production

To optimize the permitme client for production, run:

    ./gradlew -Pprod clean bootRepackage

This will concatenate and minify CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references
these new files.

To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar build/libs/*.war --spring.profiles.active=prod

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Testing

Unit tests are run by [Karma][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in `src/test/javascript/` and can be run with:

    gulp test



## Continuous Integration

To setup this project in Jenkins, use the following configuration:

* Project name: `permitme`
* Source Code Management
    * Git Repository: `git@github.com:xxxx/permitme.git`
    * Branches to build: `*/master`
    * Additional Behaviours: `Wipe out repository & force clone`
* Build Triggers
    * Poll SCM / Schedule: `H/5 * * * *`
* Build
    * Invoke Gradle script / Use Gradle Wrapper / Tasks: `-Pprod clean test bootRepackage`
* Post-build Actions
    * Publish JUnit test result report / Test Report XMLs: `build/test-results/*.xml`
