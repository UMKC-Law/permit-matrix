# permitme

Contractors in Kansas City find the permitting process cumbersome. It's difficult to understand which permits are required for a particular job and which departments need to be involved. The process of submitting permit applications can be time-consuming and often involves waiting in line, taking the contractors away from their core work. This project will explore how a mobile-first application might be able to streamline the process and reduce frustration. Key goals include:

* Reducing duplicate data entry
* Letting the application determine the required permits based on the contractor's description of the work
* Producing the required permits in PDF format for submission either in person or via email
* Making the process more transparent through plain English questions, contextual help and workflow aides that illustrate the process (e.g., showing which permits need to go to which department and why).
